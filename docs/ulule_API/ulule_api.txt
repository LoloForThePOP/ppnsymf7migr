Ulule API documentation

Do you want to dig into Ulule data or operate crowdfunding campaigns on you own website? This should be a good start.

If you have any question, send us an email at api@ulule.com or open an issue on our github repo.

We will keep you posted shortly with new features and business cases. Enjoy!
Overview

Where possible, Ulule API strives to stick to the REST convention: we use HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE and return appropriate HTTP response codes (2xx for success, 4xx for client errors and 5xx for server errors).

We use JSON to encode all resources and decode all payloads, except file uploads that must be encoded with multipart/form-data.
Pagination

Most endpoints that return a list of resources use the same pagination system. The pagination is cursor-based and returns objects created before a timestamp in reverse chronological order.
Parameters

The limit and since URL query parameters may be used to retrieve different pages.
Parameter 	Description
limit 	Maximum number of resources per page, default is 20 and maximum value is 20
since 	Cursor, must be a timestamp in seconds
Meta object

A meta object is returned in the response beside the actual resource. This object contains field describing the current page and the next page if it exists.
Field 	Description
limit 	Current limit value
next 	Query string of the next page, null if there is no more page
Example

$ curl "https://api.ulule.com/v1/projects/56599/comments?limit=10&since=1522245932"

{
    "comments": [...],
    "meta": {
        "limit": 10,
        "next": "?limit=10&since=1514912554"
    }
}

Languages

The following languages are supported by Ulule API.
Language 	Code
English 	en
French 	fr
Catalan 	ca
German 	de
Italian 	it
Spanish 	es
Dutch 	nl
Portuguese 	pt
I18n

Some payloads and resources contain fields of type i18n object. An i18n object is a JSON object that contains i18n translations. Object keys are language codes (see supported languages), and object values are translation strings.

For example, the description field of the user resource field may look like this:

{
    "en": "This is the description in english",
    "fr": "Ceci est la description en français"
}

In order to get all the translations of an i18n field in the resource, the query string parameter lang=all must be specified in the URL for the three GET, POST and PATCH HTTP methods.

$ curl "https://api.ulule.com/v1/users/105478?lang=all"

{
    "description": {
        "en": "This is a description in english",
        "fr": "Ceci est une description en français",
        "it": "Questo è descritto in italiano",
        "de": "",
        "ca": "",
        "es": ""
    }
}

If the parameter lang is not specified in the URL, the resource returned contains the translation for the parent object lang and the translations present in the request payload.

Let’s take an example project which main language is en, if you update a reward with the following payload:

{
    "description": {
        "fr": "ma superbe description"
    }
}

The returned resource will have the description field in two languages:

    en because it is the parent resource main language
    fr because it is provided in the request payload

{
    "description": {
        "en": "my awesome description",
        "fr": "ma superbe description"
    }
}

Versions

Ulule API has a versioning system to manage upgrades without breaking backward-compatibility.

We consider the following changes to be backward-incompatible:

    Removing a resource field, or changing the type of a resource field.
    Changing the validation of a parameter, or the permission required to call an endpoint.

When we must introduce a backward-incompatible change, we release a new version named after the current date. To avoid breaking external programs, these versions are always opt-in and must be explicitly requested.

To request a specific version, add the Ulule-Version HTTP header to the request.
Example

$ curl "https://api.ulule.com/v1/projects/56599" -H Ulule-Version:2017-10-10

Versions changelog
2022-10-24

    This version decreases the permission level required to use the projects.orders_list endpoint. This endpoint is now accessible anonymously. Also, data from anonymous users is now hidden. Project owners may add the ?show_anonymous=true query parameter to show private data from anonymous users.

2022-05-18

    This version splits the background field of the project resource into two fields background_color and background_image.

2022-05-17

    This version changes the background field of the project resource to an i18n object.

2020-11-10

    This version changes the video field of the project resource to an i18n object.

2020-10-07

    This version disallows invalid credentials during authentication for endpoints that can be used anonymously. Before this version, if the credentials are invalid and the endpoint can be used anonymously, the request proceeds without being authenticated. With this version, a 401 Unauthorized error is returned.

2020-08-13

    This version turns the fields_needed field from the project resource into an extra field. It must be explicitly specified.

2020-04-08

    This version changes the main_image fields of the project resource and the search-project resource to i18n objects.

2020-03-11

    This version removes the country field from the projects.orders_create payload and adds validation regarding the order shipping.

2020-01-27

    This version changes the format of the date_delivery field from the delivery from YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM.

2019-11-13

    This version removes the following fields from the project resource, the fields are always present in the delivery embedded resource:
        address_required
        phone_number_required
    This version removes the following fields from the reward resource, the fields are always present in the delivery embedded resource:
        address_required

    This version turns the delivery field from the project resource into an extra field. It must be explicitly specified.

2019-11-07

    This version removes values that do not exist from i18n objects. Before that version, non existing values were always filled with empty strings.

2019-10-28

    This version removes the following fields from the variant resource, the fields are always present in the parent embedded resource:
        address_required
        date_delivery
        num_products
        phone_number_required
        price
        project_id

2019-09-05

    This version adds unknown search qualifiers to search terms, whereas they were ignored before that version.

2019-07-24

    This version disallows forbidden fields in the projects.update and users.update JSON payloads. If a user doesn’t have the permission to set a field, a PermissionError is returned.

2019-07-05

    This version disallows unknown fields in JSON payloads. If an unknown field is present, a UnknownFieldError is returned.

2019-07-03

    This version makes the username field from the users.create payload optional. If absent, the username is deduced from the local part of the email.

2019-04-11

    This version turns the account, manager, notes, owner.stats, rewards and user_role fields from the project resource into extra_fields. They must be explicitly specified.

2019-03-07

    This version adds validation to extra fields: if the request contains an extra field that doesn’t exist, then an error is returned, instead of silently accepting the request without the extra field.

2019-03-06

    This version turns the main_image, main_tag, owner and user_role fields from the search.projects endpoint into extra_fields. They must be explicitly specified.

2019-02-07

Extra fields

Extra fields are a way to control which fields and resources are embedded in a response.

Depending on the use case, API clients sometimes don’t need embedded resources for a specific endpoint, so adding them is a waste of computing resource and network bandwidth. Other clients may want 2 or 3 levels of resource embedding on the same endpoint, so that they can get the data they need with only one request. The goal of extra fields is to address this issue.

To add an extra field to a response, add the extra_fields parameter to the URL.

For example, embed the stats resource into the user resource with the following request:
get /v1/users/:id?extra_fields=stats

To add more than one extra field, separate the values with commas.

For example, embed the analytics, partnerships and sponsorships resources into the project resource with the following request:
get /v1/projects/:id?extra_fields=analytics,partnerships,sponsorships

To nest embedded resource, separate levels of embedding with dots.

For example, embed the orders resource into the user resource, and the project resource into the order resources with the following request:
get /v1/me?extra_fields=orders,orders.project
Errors
Client error resource
Field 	Type 	Description
classification 	string 	Class of the error
fieldNames 	array of strings 	List of the concerned fields
message 	string 	Description of the error

The following values are possible for the classification field:
Classification 	Description
DeserializationError 	Payload can’t be deserialized because it is malformed
PermissionError 	User doesn’t have the permission to use this field
RequiredError 	Field is required
TypeError 	Field can’t be deserialized because of its type
UnknownFieldError 	Field is unknown
ValueError 	Bad value, the message field explains why
Permissions

A permissions field is present in some resources, it specifies the access level on specific fields of the resource for the authenticated user.

{
    "permissions": {
        "self": ["update"],
        "news": ["create"]
    }
}

Authentication

In most cases, data that is publicly readable on the Ulule website is also readable via Ulule API without authentication.

However, to read private data or to write data, requests must be authenticated.

There are three methods to authenticate requests.

    HTTP Basic
    API key
    OAuth2

To read private data, the HTTP Basic and API key methods may be used. To write data, the OAuth2 method is required.
HTTP Basic

$ curl --user "YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD" "https://api.ulule.com/v1/..."

API Key

The API key of the user can be found in the privacy settings on the Ulule website.

$ curl -H "Authorization: APIKey YOUR_API_KEY" "https://api.ulule.com/v1/..."

OAuth2

This authentication method is only accessible if you have a registered OAuth2 application. Contact api@ulule.com for more information.

Users use their access token for authentication via the Authorization HTTP header.

$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" "https://api.ulule.com/v1/..."

Retrieve an access token

To retrieve an access token, use the POST https://api.ulule.com/oauth2/token/ endpoint.

Please, do not forget the slash at the end, just after “token”. This slash is required.

The request must be authenticated with the Basic method with the credentials being your client_id and client_secret.
Payload
Field 	Description
grant_type 	Grant type – must be password
password 	User password
username 	User username
Example

$ curl -X POST \
    -d "grant_type=password&username=<username>&password=<password>" \
    -u <client_id> \
    https://api.ulule.com/oauth2/token/

{
    "access_token": "PKs6dso48MPRPa4pcKjskjIFwpQMA3",
    "expires_in": 36000,
    "refresh_token": "8Pbypw13OqJDeggvymoUc26djkPZ",
    "scope": "read write",
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}

Or use this Python script:

# access_token.py
import base64
import os

import requests

# Your partner client ID.
CLIENT_ID = os.getenv('CLIENT_ID')

# Your partner client secret.
CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv('CLIENT_SECRET')

# The user's Ulule username.
USERNAME = os.getenv('USERNAME')

# The user's Ulule password.
PASSWORD = os.getenv('PASSWORD')

# We need to encode the client ID and client secret in base64 before
# passing it as a header.
def get_basic_auth_header(user, password):
    user_pass = '{0}:{1}'.format(user, password)
    auth_string = base64.b64encode(user_pass.encode('utf-8'))
    auth_headers = {'AUTHORIZATION': 'Basic ' + auth_string.decode("utf-8")}
    return auth_headers

# Execute the POST request with: grant_type, username and password as
# POST parameters. Do not forget to add HTTP Basic header.
response = requests.post(
    'https://api.ulule.com/oauth2/token/',
    data={
        'grant_type': 'password',
        'username': USERNAME,
        'password': PASSWORD,
    },
    headers=get_basic_auth_header(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET))

# Our response.
data = response.json()

# Expect a 200 status code.
assert response.status_code == 200

print('Access-Token: %s' % data.get('access_token'))
print('Refresh-Token: %s' % data.get('refresh_token'))

This script can be easily rewritten in any programing langage.

You can run this script by installing the requests package and passing variables as environment variables:

$ pip install requests
$ CLIENT_ID=your-client-id CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret USERNAME=user-username PASSWORD=user-password python access_token.py
Access-Token: user-access-token
Refresh-Token: user-refresh-token

You now have an access token to authenticate the user.
Refresh the access token

Access tokens expire after 10 hours.

Because you don’t store user passwords in plain text in your database, you can’t generate new access tokens automatically without asking the user credentials again. In terms of user experience, this would be pretty bad.

To address this issue, we also provide a refresh token which allows you to generate a new access token:

# refresh_token.py
import base64
import os

import requests

# Your partner client ID.
CLIENT_ID = os.getenv('CLIENT_ID')

# Your partner client secret.
CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv('CLIENT_SECRET')

# The user's refresh token.
REFRESH_TOKEN = os.getenv('REFRESH_TOKEN')

# We need to encode the client ID and client secret in base64 before
# passing it as a header.
def get_basic_auth_header(user, password):
    user_pass = '{0}:{1}'.format(user, password)
    auth_string = base64.b64encode(user_pass.encode('utf-8'))
    auth_headers = {'AUTHORIZATION': 'Basic ' + auth_string.decode("utf-8")}
    return auth_headers

# Execute the POST request with: grant_type and refresh_token
# POST parameters. Do not forget to add HTTP Basic header.
response = requests.post(
    'https://api.ulule.com/oauth2/token/',
    data={
        'grant_type': 'refresh_token',
        'refresh_token': REFRESH_TOKEN,
    },
    headers=get_basic_auth_header(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET))

# Our response.
data = response.json()

# Expect a 200 status code.
assert response.status_code == 200

print('Access-Token: %s' % data.get('access_token'))

You can run this script by installing the requests package and passing variables as environment variables:

$ pip install requests
$ CLIENT_ID=your-client-id CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret REFRESH_TOKEN=user-refresh-token python refresh_token.py
Access-Token: user-access-token

You now have a new access token to re-authenticate the user.
Ulule Connect

Ulule connect allows users to connect their Ulule account to partner websites.

The workflow is:

    User is on partner website
    Partner needs to access user data
    User clicks on “Sign In” button on partner website
    This button redirects to Ulule connect URL
    If the user does not have an existing Ulule account, the interface offers to create a new one
    If the user already has an account, he or she can sign in with his or her Ulule credentials
    At the end of sign in / sign up process, user is redirected to the redirect_uri
    The user access token is returned to the redirect_uri

Authorize user with Ulule Connect

The Ulule Connect URL is https://ulule.com/oauth2/authorize/.

The following query parameters are required.
Field 	Description
client_id 	Partner client ID
redirect_uri 	Registered partner redirect URI
response_type 	OAuth2 response type – must be token or code

A convenient way is to use this URL in a pop-up.

form.jpg authorize.jpg

The redirect URI, or redirection endpoint, is used to redirect users after sign in or sign up. Only registered redirect URIs are allowed. Only one registered URI can be set in the Ulule Connect request, but you can register as many as you want.

If response_type is token, the access token is accessible at the redirect URI as a URL fragment. You can stop reading.

If response_type is code, an access code is sent to the redirect URI via the code URL query parameters and the access token can be obtained from it. Read the next section.
Retrieve user access token from authorization code

Use the POST https://api.ulule.com/oauth2/token/ endpoint as described in the OAuth2 section.
Payload
Field 	Description
code 	Authorization code retrieved from the code URL query parameter at redirect_uri
grant_type 	Grant type – must be authorization_code
redirect_uri 	Redirected URI used to obtain the code
Example

Take a look at this Python script:

# access_token_from_code.py
import base64
import os

import requests

# Your partner client ID.
CLIENT_ID = os.getenv('CLIENT_ID')

# Your partner client secret.
CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv('CLIENT_SECRET')

# The grant code.
GRANT_CODE = os.getenv('GRANT_CODE')

# Your registered redirect URI.
REDIRECT_URI = os.getenv('REDIRECT_URI')

# We need to encode in base64 the client_id and client_secret before
# passing it as a header.
def get_basic_auth_header(user, password):
    user_pass = '{0}:{1}'.format(user, password)
    auth_string = base64.b64encode(user_pass.encode('utf-8'))
    auth_headers = {'AUTHORIZATION': 'Basic ' + auth_string.decode("utf-8")}
    return auth_headers

# Execute the POST request with: grant_type, code and redirect_uri as
# POST parameters. Do not forget to add HTTP Basic header.
response = requests.post(
    'https://api.ulule.com/oauth2/token/',
    data={
        'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
        'code': GRANT_CODE,
        'redirect_uri': REDIRECT_URI,
    },
    headers=get_basic_auth_header(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET))

# Our response.
data = response.json()

# Expect a 200 status code.
assert response.status_code == 200

print('Access-Token: %s' % data.get('access_token'))
print('Refresh-Token: %s' % data.get('refresh_token'))

You can run this script by installing the requests package and passing variables as environment variables:

$ pip install requests
$ CLIENT_ID=your-client-id CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret GRANT_CODE=your-grant-code REDIRECT_URI=your-redirect-uri python access_token_from_code.py
Access-Token: user-access-token
Refresh-Token: user-refresh-token

Guest users

It’s possible to authenticate a user with just an email, and without creating a user account. Guest users have limited access to Ulule API, which is defined and documented per endpoint.
Create a guest user

To create a guest user and retrieve an access token, the workflow is similar to the OAuth2 method. Use the POST https://api.ulule.com/oauth2/token/ endpoint with the guest_email grant type.
Payload
Field 	Description
email 	User email
grant_type 	Grant type – must be guest_email

Webhooks

Webhooks allow partners to receive notifications about events happening on the Ulule platform.

When an event occurs, for example when a order succeeds, Ulule creates an Event object. This object contains all the relevant information, including the type of event and the URI of the resource associated with that event.

Ulule then sends the Event object in the body of an HTTP POST request to the registered URL of a partner.
Event object

An event object typically looks like the following:

{
    "created": "2015-09-01T16:40:05.805422",
    "object": "event",
    "resource": {
        "type": "project",
        "uri": "https://api.ulule.com/v1/projects/53423"
    },
    "type": "project.funded",
}

Configuring a server to receive webhooks

Configuring a server to receive webhooks is very close to creating a new page on a website.

With PHP, you might create a new .php file on your server. With a framework like Flask, you would add a new route with the desired URL.

Remember, with webhooks, your server is the server receiving the request.

FAQ
When I visit a project page on the Ulule website, I see the following message: “This project was taken offline at the request of the project owner”. What does that mean and is there a corresponding field in the project resource?

Projects owners can decide to cancel their project at any time for any reason. In that case the project is still considered online (is_online in the project resource) but the content is not visible and there can be no orders.

The corresponding field in the project resource is is_cancelled.
How can project owners add images to their project description?

That’s what the images of type secondary are for.

The workflow is the following:

    Upload the image via the create image endpoint.
    Edit the project description via the update project endpoint, add the full version of the image.

Why is the reward.delivery_date field required?

We consider that when a project is launched on Ulule, it is a commitment for the project owner to deliver the rewards, even the symbolic ones.
What is the distinction between account.is_completed and account.status? Why allowing a project owner to submit a project when is_completed is set to true, but status is not yet succeeded?

is_completed is automatically set when the project owner has completed all required fields in the account form. status is automatically set when the account validation succeeds or fails.

The account validation process can take some time (~1 working day) and the project owner doesn’t have any progress information about it so it doesn’t make sense to forbid the project submission.

It is the role of the project manager to check the account form. The manager should wait for the account to be validated before validating the project. In case of an invalid account, the manager can ask the project owner to go back to the account form to edit the information.

It may be possible for a project to be validated and to go online before the account is validated, especially if the project owner wants to launch ASAP. This is up to the appreciation and judgement of the project manager.
How can a project owner remove the image field of an image of type background, to only have the background color?

Indeed it’s not possible to set the image field of a background image to null because the payload format is form-data. The way to go is to delete the image resource before creating a new one.
What happens if, during the campaign, a project owner wants to switch the account type, for example from individual to business?

It’s not possible for the project owner to create a new account if the project status is validated or online. In such a case, the project owner must ask to the project manager.
Why is the project.nb_products_sold field different from the sum of reward.stock_taken fields ?

For project of type presale, the nb_products_sold field is the number of orders. A baker can choose to create an order with any quantity of a reward.
