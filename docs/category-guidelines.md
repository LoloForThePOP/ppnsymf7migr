# Category Guidelines

Purpose: help humans (and later UI tooltips) map projects to the right category.
Use evidence from the source text only; avoid guessing.

borGeneral rules:
- Choose the category that matches the main intent of the project.
- If multiple categories apply, pick the strongest signal in the text.
- For ambiguous "material" cases, default to Fabrication d'objet.
